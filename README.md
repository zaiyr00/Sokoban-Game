# Sokoban-Game
Sokoban (倉庫番, Sōko-ban) is a puzzle video game genre in which the player pushes crates or boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.
This game was developed using the MVC pattern in the Kotlin Programming Language. For the user interface I used the Canvas Framework. I also used a two-dimensional array of integers as an abstract model for my levels in which:
<h5>
  FLOOR = 0
</h5>
<h5>
  BRICK_WAll = 1
</h5>
<h5>
  BOX = 2
</h5>
<h5>
  TARGET = 3
</h5>
<h5>
  PLAYER = 4
</h5>

When loading a level, I used a copy of a two-dimensional array and manipulated it while the player was moving.
